Kittynode is a control center for world computer operators. It's designed so that anyone in the world can easily get started running an Ethereum node. The codebase is architected to be modular, extensible, and secure.

## Modules

Kittynode is split into packages that cover the core logic, user interfaces, and remote bindings. The clear boundaries let us reason about security per module, reuse the same code everywhere, and add features without reshaping the rest of the system.

| Package          | What it does                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kittynode-core` | Rust library that defines the APIs, Docker integration, manifests, and persistence shared by every surface |
| `kittynode-cli`  | Thin command-line wrapper that forwards subcommands to the core API for headless environments and can host the web service when requested |
| `kittynode-app`  | Tauri desktop/mobile shell with the Svelte UI that talks to the core directly or through HTTP              |
| `kittynode-web`  | Axum HTTP service that exposes the core API for remote management and automation                           |

### Core API Facade

- Consumers import from `kittynode_core::api` and `kittynode_core::api::types` only.
- Internal layers (`application`, `domain`, `infra`, `manifests`) remain crate-internal to allow refactors without consumer churn.

### Core internals

Inside `kittynode-core` the folders map directly to responsibilities:

- `application` orchestrates use cases such as installing packages, generating validator data, and managing capabilities.
- `domain` defines the data types that move between layers as plain structs and enums.
- `infra` talks to Docker through Bollard, manages files under `~/.kittynode`, and persists configuration.
- `manifests` holds package definitions. Each manifest describes the containers, networks, and volumes needed for a stack like Ethereum.

This split keeps privileged logic small and makes it straightforward to add new behaviours without touching every consumer.

## Technology Stack

The entire technology stack was carefully selected so Kittynode can quickly and securely scale development. We plan to audit every single line of code.

- **Core library**: Rust for safety, performance, and cross-platform compatibility
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 with shadcn-svelte
- **Desktop app**: Tauri for cross-platform apps
- **CLI**: Pure Rust binary consumes the core library

## User facing apps

Kittynode has three user facing apps:

- A command line interface available on desktop.
- A desktop app.
- A mobile app.

Every app uses the same core library, and the desktop/mobile app uses the same frontend codebase. By re-using components, Kittynode is easier to audit and more secure, with less lines of code.

The Tauri app switches between a local client and an HTTP client (`kittynode-web`) based on the configured server URL, so we can manage a remote node without changing UI code. Remote mode disables sensitive flows like key generation on the controlling device but still surfaces live status from the node. When operators enable the web API from the CLI, the same binary spawns a background process that runs `kittynode-web`, so installing `kittynode-cli` is sufficient to expose HTTP bindings.

## Capabilities

There are several capabilities you can add to your Kittynode which augment the threat model. We default to minimizing the capabilities of the Kittynode, while giving enough features to get started.

Here are a few example capabilities related to remote access:

- **Read only (default)**: Kittynode is a read-only monitoring application.
- **Local only**: Kittynode can update local node infrastructure from the host machine.
- **Private onchain requests**: Kittynode can update local node infrastructure via listening to private requests submitted onchain.
- **Local HTTPS server**: Kittynode can update local node infrastructure via requests that come from the same Wireguard network (but a different machine, such as a phone); these requests are authenticated by a passkey or JWT token.

Capabilities and general configuration are stored under `~/.kittynode/config.toml`.

## Package lifecycle

Package installs are declarative:

1. A manifest returns a `Package` with default configuration and container definitions.
2. `infra::package::install_package` creates the Docker network, pulls images, and starts the containers.
3. `infra::package::delete_package` stops containers, removes Docker resources, and cleans any files that were mounted.

Because the manifests are normal Rust code, adding a new stack mainly means writing one manifest and any matching UI strings.

## Operational state

`kittynode-core` reports mode, Docker health, and diagnostics through `get_operational_state`. If Docker is not running and auto-start is enabled, `start_docker_if_needed` will try to launch Docker Desktop once and return a status so the UI can inform the operator. Hardware, storage, and OS details come from `get_system_info` and feed into the same status views.

## Features

### Package ecosystem

Kittynode supports a package ecosystem. Ethereum nodes are simply packages which are executed and managed by Kittynode. Developers can create their own packages easily with Kittynode's package API. Kittynode supports Docker images but also supports direct binary executables. Kittynode may also support other languages and executable scripts in the future.

The design goals of the package ecosystem are to ensure installs are:

- **Secure**: Packages are securely isolated from each other.
- **Consistent**: Packages behave the same on all systems.
- **Atomic**: Package installs and uninstalls are atomic, without polluting the system.

### System checker

The system checker is a utility within Kittynode that checks the system prerequisites for running a node, along with other system checks. A short list of some checks are:

- **System resources**: Checking the available storage, CPU, and RAM.
- **Network settings**: Checking the firewall and internet connectivity.
- **Security settings**: Checking file permissions and other system security settings.

The system checker is important in several areas of Kittynode. For example, when creating a validator key it is important to ensure WiFi is disabled, and file permissions are properly set on the key file.

### Remote access

Kittynode supports remote access. This means you can setup and monitor your node from a phone or desktop. This is currently done via a secure connection over Wireguard, which allows users to monitor their node from trusted devices. This also allows users to easily upgrade their nodes from anywhere, which is important for voting. There are plans to support another mechanism for remote management as well, which doesn't even require a direct connection.
