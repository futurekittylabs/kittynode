Kittynode is a control center for world computer operators. It's designed so that anyone in the world can easily get started running an Ethereum node. The entire process of setting up a node is encapsulated within the Kittynode app:

- Installing and starting Docker or Kubernetes for the user
- Installing an Ethereum node in a few clicks
- Configuring a validator all without leaving the app:
  - Generate validator/withdrawal keys
  - Submit 32 ETH deposit transaction

After setting up a node, the operator can monitor it from anywhere in the world with the mobile app.

## Modules

Kittynode is comprised of several modules that compose together to create seamless and secure experiences for node operators. It also allows us to understand the security boundaries of each module with more clarity. By re-using code and keeping important modules isolated, we increase the security of the entire system for node operators.

| Package          | Description                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `kittynode-core` | Core Rust library powering all Kittynode applications |
| `kittynode-cli`  | Command-line interface built on the core library      |
| `kittynode-app`  | Cross-platform Tauri app with Svelte frontend         |
| `kittynode-web`  | Web server binding to the core library                |

### Core API Facade

- Consumers import from `kittynode_core::api` and `kittynode_core::api::types` only.
- Internal layers (`application`, `domain`, `infra`, `manifests`) remain crate-internal to allow refactors without consumer churn.

## Technology Stack

The entire technology stack was carefully selected so Kittynode can quickly and securely scale development. We plan to audit every single line of code.

- **Core library**: Rust for safety, performance, and cross-platform compatibility
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 with shadcn-svelte
- **Desktop app**: Tauri for cross-platform apps
- **CLI**: Pure Rust binary consumes the core library

## User facing apps

Kittynode has three user facing apps:

- A command line interface available on desktop.
- A desktop app.
- A mobile app.

Every app uses the same core library, and the desktop/mobile app uses the same frontend codebase. By re-using components, Kittynode is easier to audit and more secure, with less lines of code.

## Capabilities

There are several capabilities you can add to your Kittynode which augment the threat model. We default to minimizing the capabilities of the Kittynode, while giving enough features to get started.

Here are a few example capabilities related to remote access:

- **Read only (default)**: Kittynode is a read-only monitoring application.
- **Local only**: Kittynode can update local node infrastructure from the host machine.
- **Private onchain requests**: Kittynode can update local node infrastructure via listening to private requests submitted onchain.
- **Local HTTPS server**: Kittynode can update local node infrastructure via requests that come from the same Wireguard network (but a different machine, such as a phone); these requests are authenticated by a passkey or JWT token.

## Features

### Package ecosystem

Kittynode supports a package ecosystem. Ethereum nodes are simply packages which are executed and managed by Kittynode. Developers can create their own packages easily with Kittynode's package API. Kittynode supports Docker images but also supports direct binary executables. Kittynode may also support other languages and executable scripts in the future.

The design goals of the package ecosystem are to ensure installs are:

- **Secure**: Packages are securely isolated from each other.
- **Consistent**: Packages behave the same on all systems.
- **Atomic**: Package installs and uninstalls are atomic, without polluting the system.

### System checker

The system checker is a utility within Kittynode that checks the system prerequisites for running a node, along with other system checks. A short list of some checks are:

- **System resources**: Checking the available storage, CPU, and RAM.
- **Network settings**: Checking the firewall and internet connectivity.
- **Security settings**: Checking file permissions and other system security settings.

The system checker is important in several areas of Kittynode. For example, when creating a validator key it is important to ensure WiFi is disabled, and file permissions are properly set on the key file.

### Remote access

Kittynode supports remote access. This means you can setup and monitor your node from a phone or desktop. This is currently done via a secure connection over Wireguard, which allows users to monitor their node from trusted devices. This also allows users to easily upgrade their nodes from anywhere, which is important for voting. There are plans to support another mechanism for remote management as well, which doesn't even require a direct connection.
