This guide covers the recommended setup: install Kittynode CLI on a dedicated machine, secure access with Tailscale, then connect from the Kittynode desktop app.

## Overview

- Dedicated machine runs your node with `kittynode-cli`
- Your desktop app connects over a private Tailscale network
- Docker provides isolation for node services

## 1) Prepare the dedicated machine

- Any modern Linux box works; Ubuntu is a common choice
- Ensure basic tools are installed:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl git
  ```

## 2) Install Docker on the node

Follow: [/guides/install-docker](/guides/install-docker)

## 3) Join both devices to the same tailnet

Follow: [/guides/tailscale](/guides/tailscale)

Both the dedicated machine and your desktop must be connected to the same Tailscale network for secure access.

## 4) Install Kittynode CLI on the node

- Recommended: Download from the official page: https://kittynode.com/download
- Developers: You can also install from crates.io:

  ```bash
  cargo install kittynode-cli
  ```

## 5) Start the web service on the node

<Steps>

1. Start the local web API:

    ```bash
    kittynode web start
    ```

2. Copy the node’s Tailscale IP:

    ```bash
    tailscale ip -4
    ```

</Steps>

## 6) Connect from the desktop app

<Steps>

1. Install and open the Kittynode desktop app.
2. In Settings, set the Server URL to:

    ```
    http://<tailscale-ip>:3000
    ```

3. Save and verify the app shows “Connected to remote Kittynode”.

</Steps>

Tips

- Enable MagicDNS in Tailscale to use the device name instead of the IP
- Keep both devices online in the same tailnet to maintain connectivity
- If you rotate devices, re-check the server URL in Settings
