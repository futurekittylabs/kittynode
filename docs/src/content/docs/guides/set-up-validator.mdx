This guide walks through the full Kittynode validator workflow: preparing your machines, generating keys with `kittynode validator init`, submitting deposits, monitoring remotely, and exiting when you are done.

:::note
You need two machines for the best experience: a dedicated validator host that stays online, and the computer where you run the Kittynode desktop app. Connect both with [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) so the app can securely reach the remote web service.

## Prepare your machines

<Steps>

1. Install Kittynode CLI on both machines:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Linux">
        ```bash
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://kittynode.com/sh | sh
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="macOS">
        ```bash
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://kittynode.com/sh | sh
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```bash
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://kittynode.com/ps1 | iex"
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Install and sign in to [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on both machines. Make a note of the remote machine's Tailscale name or IP address.

3. On the remote machine, install Docker and confirm it is running. Follow the [Set up Docker](https://docs.kittynode.com/guides/set-up-docker) guide if you need a refresher.

</Steps>

## Initialize the validator

Run the guided setup on the remote machine. The workflow provisions clients, configures networking, and imports keys.

```bash
kittynode validator init
```

During this flow you will:

- Choose the target network (mainnet, Hoodi testnet, or Sepolia).
- Select how many validators to run and, if desired, enable 0x02 compounding validators.
- Confirm the withdrawal address.
- Generate validator keys. Kittynode saves the keystores and deposit data in the directory you pick.
- Import the keys into Lighthouse and start the clients.

When the flow reaches the **Final steps** screen it will show the path to your `deposit_data-*.json` file. Keep the file handy—you will upload it in the next section.

## Deposit your stake

Submit the deposit data for every validator you created. Use the launchpad that matches the network you selected in the CLI.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Mainnet">
    - Open [https://launchpad.ethereum.org](https://launchpad.ethereum.org).
    - Choose **Upload deposit data** and select the `deposit_data-*.json` file generated by Kittynode.
    - Confirm the validator count and follow the checklist before signing the deposit transaction(s) with your wallet.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Hoodi">
    - Open [https://hoodi.launchpad.ethereum.org](https://hoodi.launchpad.ethereum.org).
    - Upload the same `deposit_data-*.json` file.
    - Approve the transaction for 32 test ETH per validator (or the amount you selected for compounding).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Sepolia">
    - Open [https://sepolia.launchpad.ethereum.org](https://sepolia.launchpad.ethereum.org).
    - Upload the deposit data file and follow the walkthrough to submit the testnet deposit.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the deposits land on-chain your validator(s) will enter the activation queue. Kittynode keeps the clients running until activation completes.

## Monitor with the desktop app

<Steps>

1. On the remote machine, start the Kittynode web service if it is not already running:

    ```bash
    kittynode web start
    ```

2. On your desktop machine, open the Kittynode app, go to **Settings → Remote server**, and paste the remote URL (for example `http://tailscale-name:3000`).

3. Click **Connect**. The app now performs a health check against the remote `/health` endpoint before saving the connection.

4. Once connected, the dashboard and system info pages update with remote data. If the connection fails, double-check that Tailscale is connected, Docker is running on the remote host, and the web service is listening on the expected port.

</Steps>

## Unstake your validator

When you are ready to exit:

<Steps>

1. Sign in to the remote machine and run the Lighthouse exit command from the validator container:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it kittynode-lighthouse-validator lighthouse \
      --network <network> account validator exit --all
    ```

    Replace `<network>` with the network you configured (for example `mainnet`, `hoodi`, or `sepolia`). The `--all` flag exits every imported validator; you can supply specific public keys if you prefer a partial exit.

2. Wait for the exit to finalize on-chain. You can track progress in the Kittynode app or on a community staking dashboard.

3. Once the exit and withdrawal balance are complete, transfer the funds by following the guidance on the [Ethereum withdrawal docs](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/withdrawals).

</Steps>

With these steps you can take a validator from key generation to activation, and back out safely when you need to unstake.
