This guide covers the Kittynode validator workflow: prepare your machines, run `kittynode validator init`, submit deposits, monitor remotely, and exit when you are done.

:::caution
Kittynode is in alpha and intended for testnets only. Do not follow this process on mainnet yet.
:::

:::note
You need two machines: a dedicated validator host that stays online, and the computer where you run the Kittynode desktop app. Connect both with [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) so the app can securely reach the remote web service.
:::

## Prepare your machines

<Steps>

1. Install Kittynode CLI on both machines:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Linux / macOS">
        ```bash
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://kittynode.com/sh | sh
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```bash
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://kittynode.com/ps1 | iex"
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Install and sign in to [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on each machine. Note the remote host's Tailscale name or IP.

3. On the remote host, install Docker and confirm it is running. The [Set up Docker](https://docs.kittynode.com/guides/set-up-docker) guide has the steps.

</Steps>

## Initialize the validator

Run the guided setup on the remote machine. The workflow provisions clients, configures networking, and imports keys.

```bash
kittynode validator init
```

During this flow you will:

- Choose the target network (Hoodi, Sepolia, or Ephemery).
- Pick how many validators to run and, if desired, enable 0x02 compounding validators.
- Confirm the withdrawal address.
- Generate validator keys. Kittynode saves the keystores and deposit data in the directory you pick.
- Import the keys into Lighthouse and start the clients.

When the flow reaches the final steps screen it prints the path to your `deposit_data-*.json` file. Keep that file handy—you will upload it in the next section.

## Deposit your stake

Submit the deposit data for every validator you created. Use the launchpad that matches the network you selected in the CLI.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Hoodi">
    - Open [{launchpadUrl('hoodi')}]({launchpadUrl('hoodi')}).
    - Upload the `deposit_data-*.json` file.
    - Follow the instructions to submit the deposit.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Sepolia">
    - Open [{launchpadUrl('sepolia')}]({launchpadUrl('sepolia')}).
    - Upload the `deposit_data-*.json` file.
    - Follow the instructions to submit the deposit.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Ephemery">
    - Open [{launchpadUrl('ephemery')}]({launchpadUrl('ephemery')}).
    - Upload the `deposit_data-*.json` file.
    - Follow the instructions to submit the deposit.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the deposits land on-chain your validator(s) will enter the activation queue. Kittynode keeps the clients running until activation completes.

## Monitor with the desktop app

<Steps>

1. On the remote machine, start the Kittynode web service if it is not already running:

    ```bash
    kittynode web start
    ```

2. On your desktop machine, open the Kittynode app, go to **Settings → Remote server**, and paste the remote URL (for example `http://tailscale-name:3000`).

3. Click **Connect**. The app checks the remote `/health` endpoint before saving the connection.

4. Once connected, the dashboard and system info pages load remote data. If the check fails, confirm Tailscale is connected, Docker is running, and the web service is listening on the expected port.

</Steps>

## Unstake your validator

When you are ready to exit:

<Steps>

1. Sign in to the remote machine and run the Lighthouse exit command from the validator container:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it kittynode-lighthouse-validator lighthouse \
      --network <network> account validator exit --all
    ```

    Replace `<network>` with the network you configured (`hoodi`, `sepolia`, or `ephemery`). The `--all` flag exits every imported validator; supply specific public keys if you prefer a partial exit.

2. Wait for the exit to finalize on-chain. You can track progress in the Kittynode app or on a community staking dashboard.

3. After the exit and withdrawal balance finalize, transfer the funds by following the [Ethereum withdrawal docs](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/withdrawals).

</Steps>

With these steps you can take a validator from key generation to activation, and back out safely when you need to unstake.
