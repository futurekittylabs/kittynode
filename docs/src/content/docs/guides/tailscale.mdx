Tailscale creates a private, encrypted network between your devices using WireGuard. This guide shows the simplest way to install Tailscale on a server/CLI machine (your node) and on your desktop, then connect them so you can manage a remote Kittynode securely.

## What you’ll do

- Install Tailscale on the machine running `kittynode-cli` (your node)
- Install Tailscale on your desktop (or phone)
- Sign in to the same tailnet so both devices can see each other
- Connect the Kittynode desktop app to the node over Tailscale

## Install Tailscale

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="Linux">

  <Steps>

  1. On the CLI/server machine (recommended for dedicated nodes), install Tailscale:

      ```bash
      curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
      ```

  2. Bring the node online and sign in:

      ```bash
      sudo tailscale up
      ```

      On headless servers this prints a URL. Open it on any browser to authenticate.

  3. Confirm it’s connected and copy its Tailscale IP:

      ```bash
      tailscale status
      tailscale ip -4
      ```

  4. For a Linux desktop, you can also install via your distro’s package manager or from the downloads page: https://tailscale.com/download/linux

  </Steps>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="macOS">

  - Install the Tailscale app (recommended for desktop): https://tailscale.com/download/macos
  - Or with Homebrew: `brew install --cask tailscale`
  - Sign in with the same account as the CLI machine.
  - Verify devices in the app or admin panel: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Windows">

  - Install the Tailscale app: https://tailscale.com/download/windows
  - Sign in with the same account as the CLI machine.
  - Verify devices in the app or admin panel: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Connect both machines to the same tailnet

- Use the same Tailscale account (or be invited to the same tailnet).
- Each device gets a private 100.x.x.x address. On the node, copy it with `tailscale ip -4`.
- For security, devices in your tailnet can only be accessed by other devices in the same tailnet by default.
- If running Kittynode on a dedicated machine with the CLI, ensure your desktop and the node are both connected to this same tailnet.

## Use with Kittynode

<Steps>

1. On the CLI machine (your node), start the web service:

    ```bash
    kittynode web start
    ```

    By default this binds on port 3000.

2. Find the node’s Tailscale IP:

    ```bash
    tailscale ip -4
    ```

3. In the Kittynode desktop app, open Settings and set the Server URL to:

    ```
    http://<tailscale-ip>:3000
    ```

    Ensure both the desktop and the CLI machine stay connected to the same Tailscale network.

</Steps>

> Tip: If you enable Tailscale MagicDNS, you can use the device name instead of the IP.
